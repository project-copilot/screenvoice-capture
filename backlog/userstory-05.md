User Story

Title:

Implement Server-Side Token Validation

Description:

As a developer, I want to implement server-side validation of Google tokens to ensure secure and reliable authentication, allowing only authenticated users to access premium features.

Acceptance Criteria:

The backend server should receive the Google token from the Chrome extension after the user signs in.

The server must validate the received token with the Google Auth API to confirm its authenticity.

Upon successful validation, the server should create or update the user record in the database and issue a session token for further interactions.

If the token validation fails, the server should return an appropriate error message to the Chrome extension, indicating the failure and suggesting the user re-authenticate.

The implementation should ensure that all API calls related to premium features are gated based on the user's authentication status.

Technical Reference:

Token Reception and Forwarding (Backend Developer)

Implement an endpoint to receive the Google token from the Chrome extension.

Ensure secure transmission of the token to prevent interception.

Token Validation (Backend Developer)

Integrate with the Google Auth API to validate the received token.

Handle responses from the Google Auth API, including success and failure scenarios.

User Record Management (Backend Developer)

Create or update user records in the database based on the validation result.

Implement logic to issue a session token upon successful validation.

Error Handling (Backend Developer)

Develop a mechanism to return clear error messages to the Chrome extension in case of validation failure.

Ensure the error handling process is user-friendly and provides guidance for re-authentication.

Implementation Steps:

Set up the endpoint to receive the Google token (sequential).

Implement token validation with the Google Auth API (sequential).

Create or update user records based on validation results (sequential).

Develop error handling for failed validations (sequential).

This implementation will enhance the security of the Chrome extension by ensuring that only authenticated users can access premium features, aligning with the overall goal of providing a secure and reliable user experience.
