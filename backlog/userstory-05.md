User Story

Title:

Backend Token Validation

Description:

User:
As a developer working on the Chrome extension

Action:
I want to validate Google tokens on the backend

Outcome:
So that I can ensure secure authentication for users accessing premium features

Acceptance Criteria:

The backend receives the Google token from the Chrome extension upon user sign-in.

The backend successfully validates the token with the Google Auth API.

If the token is valid, the backend creates or updates the user record in the database.

A session token is issued to the user upon successful validation.

The system logs any failed validation attempts for security auditing.

Appropriate error messages are returned to the frontend for invalid tokens.

Technical Reference:

Implement a RESTful API endpoint (POST /auth/google) for token validation.

Use the Google Auth API to verify the token and retrieve user information.

Ensure secure storage of session tokens using JWT.

Implement logging for both successful and failed authentication attempts.

Follow best practices for error handling and user feedback in the Chrome extension.

Scenarios:

Happy Path:

User successfully signs in with Google, and the backend validates the token, creating a user session.

Invalid Token:

User attempts to sign in with an expired or invalid token, and the backend returns an appropriate error message.

Network Error:

User's token validation request fails due to network issues, and the system handles the error gracefully, prompting the user to try again.
