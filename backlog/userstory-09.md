User Story

Title:

Set Up Webhooks for Subscription Management

Description:

As a developer, I want to set up webhooks to handle subscription creation, updates, and cancellations so that the backend remains in sync with Stripe's subscription status.

Acceptance Criteria:

The backend should be able to receive and process webhook events from Stripe for subscription creation, updates, and cancellations.

Upon receiving a subscription creation event, the backend should create a corresponding user subscription record in the database.

Upon receiving a subscription update event, the backend should update the existing user subscription record with the new status and details.

Upon receiving a subscription cancellation event, the backend should mark the user subscription as canceled in the database.

The system should log all webhook events for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

The backend should validate the authenticity of incoming webhook requests from Stripe to ensure security.

Technical Reference:

Set Up Webhook Endpoint (Backend Developer)

Create a secure endpoint in the backend to receive webhook events from Stripe.

Implement authentication to verify that incoming requests are from Stripe.

Ensure the endpoint can handle different types of webhook events related to subscriptions.

Process Subscription Creation Event (Backend Developer)

Implement logic to create a new user subscription record in the database upon receiving a subscription creation event.

Ensure that all relevant subscription details (e.g., user ID, subscription status, plan details) are captured.

Process Subscription Update Event (Backend Developer)

Implement logic to update the existing user subscription record in the database when a subscription update event is received.

Ensure that the updated status and any other relevant details are accurately reflected in the database.

Process Subscription Cancellation Event (Backend Developer)

Implement logic to mark the user subscription as canceled in the database upon receiving a cancellation event.

Ensure that any necessary cleanup or notifications are handled appropriately.

Log Webhook Events (Backend Developer)

Implement logging for all received webhook events to facilitate auditing and troubleshooting.

Ensure that logs capture essential information such as event type, timestamp, and any relevant payload data.

Implementation Steps:

Set Up Webhook Endpoint:

Create the endpoint and implement authentication (sequential)

Test the endpoint with sample webhook events from Stripe (sequential)

Process Subscription Events:

Implement logic for handling subscription creation, updates, and cancellations (sequential)

Test each processing logic with various event scenarios (parallelizable)

Log Webhook Events:

Implement logging functionality for webhook events (sequential)

Test logging to ensure all events are captured correctly (parallelizable)

The setup of webhooks for subscription management can be implemented by a backend developer familiar with Stripe's API and webhooks. The steps should be executed sequentially to ensure proper handling of events, with some testing steps being parallelizable to optimize time.
