User Story

Title:

Implement Feature Gating

Description:

User:
As a developer working on the Chrome extension

Action:
I want to implement feature gating to restrict access to the voice-to-text functionality for non-subscribed users

Outcome:
So that only subscribed users can utilize this premium feature, ensuring a secure and exclusive experience for paying customers

Acceptance Criteria:

The system checks the user's subscription status before enabling the voice-to-text feature.

Non-subscribed users receive a notification indicating that the feature is available only to premium subscribers.

All API calls related to the voice-to-text functionality are validated against the user's subscription status on the server.

The Chrome extension provides a clear pathway for users to subscribe to the premium tier if they wish to access the voice-to-text feature.

Subscription status is updated in real-time, reflecting any changes made through the Stripe Customer Portal.

Technical Reference:

Implement client-side checks in the Chrome extension to verify subscription status stored in local storage.

Develop server-side validation logic to ensure that only users with an active subscription can access the voice-to-text API endpoints.

Integrate Stripe webhooks to update user subscription status in the database upon changes made in the Stripe Customer Portal.

Ensure that the user interface clearly indicates the premium features and guides users on how to subscribe.

Scenarios:

Happy Path:

A subscribed user accesses the voice-to-text feature and successfully utilizes it without any restrictions.

Non-Subscribed User:

A non-subscribed user attempts to access the voice-to-text feature and receives a notification prompting them to subscribe for access.

Subscription Update:

A user upgrades their subscription through the Stripe Customer Portal and immediately gains access to the voice-to-text feature.

API Call Validation:

A non-subscribed user attempts to make an API call to the voice-to-text functionality, and the server responds with an error indicating insufficient permissions.
