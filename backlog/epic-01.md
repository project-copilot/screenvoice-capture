Title: Voice-to-Text Functionality for Screenshot Enhancer

Description:

Objective:
The primary goal of this epic is to implement voice-to-text functionality in the Screenshot Enhancer extension, enhancing user experience by allowing users to capture voice input, preview transcribed text, and save both screenshots and text efficiently. This feature aims to streamline the process of creating annotated screenshots, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

Scope:
This epic encompasses three key user stories:

- **Voice Capture:** Introduce a button in the extension that activates the Web Speech API for recording user voice. The button will provide visual feedback during recording, ensuring users are aware of the status. Error handling will be implemented for scenarios where the browser does not support the API or when microphone permissions are not granted.

- **Text Preview:** Develop an interface that displays the transcribed text alongside the captured screenshot. Users will have the ability to edit the transcribed text, ensuring accuracy and relevance. The design will accommodate various text lengths and include considerations for edge cases.

- **Content Saving:** Extend the existing save functionality to allow users to save the screenshot and transcribed text as separate files. Users will have the option to choose what to save—either the image, the text, or both—through a clear and intuitive interface with checkboxes.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Successful implementation of the voice capture feature with clear visual indicators during recording.
- A functional text preview interface that allows for editing and displays the transcribed text alongside the screenshot.
- Enhanced save functionality that provides users with options to save the screenshot, transcribed text, or both, with appropriate file formats.

Implementation Strategy:
The implementation will follow Agile methodologies, with a phased approach to feature rollout. The voice capture and text preview functionalities will be developed in the first sprint, followed by the content saving feature in the subsequent sprint. Continuous integration and deployment practices will be employed to facilitate iterative testing and refinement based on user feedback.

Milestones:

- **Research and Planning:** Gather insights on user needs and preferences to inform the design and functionality of the voice-to-text feature.
- **Development and Testing:** Implement the voice capture and text preview features, ensuring thorough testing for usability and performance.
- **Launch and Evaluation:** Roll out the features to users, monitor engagement, and collect feedback for ongoing improvements.

Dependencies:

- Collaboration between product management, development, UX/UI design, and QA teams.
- Integration with the existing Screenshot Enhancer extension infrastructure.
- Utilization of the Web Speech API, ensuring compatibility with supported browsers.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

- **User Resistance:** Actively monitor user feedback and be prepared to iterate on features based on input.
- **Technical Challenges:** Conduct robust testing and have contingency plans for rollbacks if issues arise during implementation.
- **Performance Impact:** Optimize the new features to ensure minimal impact on the extension's performance and responsiveness.
