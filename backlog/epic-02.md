Title: 

Implement Google Authentication

Description:

Objective:
Develop and integrate Google Authentication into the Chrome extension to allow users to sign in securely. This epic aims to enhance user security and streamline the authentication process, ensuring a seamless experience for users accessing premium features.

Scope:

Implement Google Sign-In using the Chrome Identity API.

Set up the Google OAuth process for user authentication.

Validate Google tokens on the backend to ensure secure authentication.

Integrate the authentication flow with the existing backend services.

Ensure that the authentication process aligns with the overall architecture of the Chrome extension, particularly in relation to Stripe subscription management.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can successfully sign in using their Google accounts.

The backend validates Google tokens and creates or updates user records accordingly.

The authentication process is secure and complies with best practices for handling sensitive information.

Users receive appropriate feedback during the sign-in process, including error messages for failed attempts.

The integration does not negatively impact the performance of the Chrome extension.

Implementation Strategy:

Initiate Google Sign-In from the Chrome extension using the Chrome Identity API.

Send the obtained Google token to the backend for validation.

Validate the token with the Google Auth API on the backend.

Upon successful validation, create or update the user record in the database and issue a session token.

Conduct thorough testing to ensure the authentication flow works as intended and is secure.

Milestones:

Design the authentication flow and user interface for Google Sign-In.

Implement the Google Sign-In functionality in the Chrome extension.

Set up the backend to handle token validation and user record management.

Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between the extension and backend.

Deploy the updated Chrome extension with Google Authentication.

Dependencies:

Google Auth API for token validation.

Existing backend services for user management.

Chrome Identity API for initiating Google Sign-In.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

Security vulnerabilities: Conduct regular security audits and implement best practices for token handling.

User experience issues: Provide clear instructions and feedback during the sign-in process to minimize confusion.

Integration challenges: Ensure thorough testing of the authentication flow to identify and resolve any issues before deployment.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to sign in using my Google account so that I can access the extension securely.

As a developer, I want to validate Google tokens on the backend to ensure secure authentication.
