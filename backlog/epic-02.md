Title: 

Implement Google Authentication

Description:

Objective:
The primary goal of this task is to implement Google Authentication within the Chrome extension, enabling users to securely sign in before accessing premium features. This integration will enhance user security and streamline the login process, ensuring a seamless experience while maintaining robust authentication standards.

Scope:
This task encompasses the following key components:

Google OAuth Setup: Configure the Google OAuth process to facilitate user authentication through their Google accounts.

Token Validation: Implement server-side validation of the Google tokens to ensure secure and reliable authentication.

User Experience: Design a user-friendly interface for the sign-in process, ensuring that it is intuitive and aligns with the overall extension design.

Session Management: Establish a session management system that maintains user login status and handles session expiration appropriately.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can successfully sign in using their Google accounts without encountering errors.

The system validates Google tokens on the server-side, ensuring that only authenticated users can access premium features.

User feedback indicates a positive experience with the new sign-in process.

The implementation adheres to security best practices, including secure token storage and HTTPS enforcement.

Implementation Strategy:
The implementation will follow an Agile approach, allowing for iterative development and testing. The process will include:

Research and Planning: Gather requirements and insights on user authentication preferences.

Development: Build the Google Authentication feature, ensuring integration with the existing backend.

Testing: Conduct thorough testing to validate the authentication flow and user experience.

Deployment: Roll out the feature to users, monitoring for any issues and gathering feedback for future improvements.

Dependencies:

Collaboration with the backend development team to ensure proper integration of the Google OAuth process.

Coordination with the UX/UI design team to create an intuitive sign-in interface.

Integration with existing user management systems to maintain user records and session data.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

User Confusion: Provide clear instructions and support for users during the sign-in process to minimize confusion.

Token Security: Implement robust security measures for token handling, including secure storage and regular audits.

Technical Challenges: Prepare for potential integration issues by conducting thorough testing and having rollback plans in place if necessary.
