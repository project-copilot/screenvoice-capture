Title: Implement Voice-to-Text Feature for Screenshot Descriptions in the Screenshot Enhancer Extension

Description:

### Objective:
Develop and integrate voice-to-text capabilities into the Screenshot Enhancer extension, allowing users to add descriptions to screenshots using voice input. This feature aims to enhance user experience by providing a quicker and more convenient way to annotate screenshots.

### Scope:
- Implement voice capture functionality using the Web Speech API when the user clicks a button in the extension popup.
- Design and integrate a user interface to preview and edit the transcribed text alongside the screenshot within the extension.
- Extend the save functionality to include options for saving the text and image, allowing users to choose whether to save the screenshot, the transcribed text, or both.
- Ensure compatibility with various browsers and handle cases where the Web Speech API is not supported.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can record voice input by clicking a button in the extension popup.
- The system successfully captures and transcribes voice input into text with reasonable accuracy.
- A preview interface displays the transcribed text alongside the screenshot, allowing users to edit the text if necessary.
- Users have the option to save the screenshot, the transcribed text, or both.
- The feature handles errors gracefully, including lack of microphone permissions or unsupported browsers, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
- The voice recording button provides visual feedback when active (e.g., color change or animation).
- The performance of the extension remains responsive, with minimal impact on load times.

### Implementation Strategy:
- **Phase 1: Voice Capture**
  - Integrate the Web Speech API to enable voice input.
  - Add a recording button to the extension popup that initiates voice capture.
  - Implement visual indicators to show when recording is in progress.
  - Handle permission requests for microphone access and unsupported browsers.

- **Phase 2: Text Preview and Editing**
  - Design the preview interface to display the transcribed text alongside a thumbnail of the screenshot.
  - Allow users to edit the transcribed text within the interface.
  - Ensure the interface adapts to various text lengths and potential edge cases.

- **Phase 3: Content Saving Options**
  - Extend the existing save functionality to include options for saving the screenshot, the transcribed text, or both.
  - Implement checkboxes or toggles in the UI to allow users to select their preferred saving options.
  - Ensure the saved files are correctly formatted and stored.

### Milestones:
1. **Voice Capture Implementation** (Sprint 1)
   - Complete integration of voice capture functionality.
   - Implement visual feedback for recording status.
   - Test microphone permission handling and error cases.

2. **Text Preview and Editing Interface** (Sprint 1)
   - Design and implement the preview interface.
   - Enable text editing capabilities.
   - Conduct usability testing for interface design.

3. **Content Saving Functionality** (Sprint 2)
   - Extend save options to include text and image choices.
   - Update UI to include save preferences.
   - Test file saving and formatting for all options.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance** (Ongoing)
   - Perform unit and integration testing for each feature.
   - Address any bugs or performance issues.
   - Finalize testing in preparation for release.

### Dependencies:
- Availability and support of the Web Speech API in the user's browser.
- User granting microphone access permissions.
- Compatibility with the existing Screenshot Enhancer extension architecture.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies:
- **Browser Compatibility Issues:**
  - *Risk:* The Web Speech API may not be supported in all browsers.
  - *Mitigation:* Implement a feature detection check and provide user feedback or alternative options when unsupported.

- **User Privacy Concerns:**
  - *Risk:* Users may be hesitant to grant microphone access due to privacy concerns.
  - *Mitigation:* Clearly communicate how voice data is used and ensure compliance with privacy policies.

- **Microphone Permission Denied:**
  - *Risk:* Users may deny microphone access, rendering the feature unusable.
  - *Mitigation:* Handle permission denial gracefully with informative messages and alternative input options.

- **Speech Recognition Accuracy:**
  - *Risk:* Transcribed text may contain errors due to recognition inaccuracies.
  - *Mitigation:* Allow users to preview and edit the transcribed text before saving.

### User Stories:
1. **Voice Capture:** Implement the Web Speech API to capture voice input when the user clicks a button in the extension popup.
2. **Text Preview:** Create an interface to preview and edit the transcribed text alongside the screenshot within the extension.
3. **Content Saving:** Extend the save functionality to include options for saving the text and image, allowing users to choose what to save.
