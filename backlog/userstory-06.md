User Story

Title:

Design User-Friendly Sign-In Interface

Description:

As a UX/UI designer, I want to design a user-friendly interface for the Google sign-in process, ensuring that it is intuitive and aligns with the overall extension design.

Acceptance Criteria:

The sign-in interface should be visually consistent with the existing Chrome extension design.

The interface must provide clear instructions for users on how to sign in using their Google account.

The sign-in process should include error handling for invalid credentials and provide user-friendly feedback.

The design should be responsive and accessible, ensuring usability across different devices and for users with disabilities.

The interface must integrate seamlessly with the backend authentication flow, allowing for secure token handling.

Technical Reference:

Design User Interface (UX/UI Designer)

Create wireframes and mockups for the Google sign-in interface.

Ensure the design adheres to Google's Material Design guidelines for consistency.

Conduct usability testing with a sample group to gather feedback on the interface.

Implement Frontend Functionality (Frontend Developer)

Develop the sign-in interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Integrate the Chrome Identity API to initiate the Google sign-in process.

Handle authentication errors and display appropriate messages to users.

Validate Authentication Tokens (Backend Developer)

Set up the backend to validate Google tokens received from the frontend.

Ensure that user sessions are created or updated based on successful authentication.

Implement security measures to protect user data during the sign-in process.

Implementation Steps:

Design User Interface:

Create wireframes and mockups (sequential)

Conduct usability testing and iterate on feedback (sequential)

Implement Frontend Functionality:

Develop the sign-in interface (sequential)

Integrate Chrome Identity API (sequential)

Test the sign-in process with various user scenarios (parallelizable)

Validate Authentication Tokens:

Set up backend token validation (sequential)

Test the authentication flow with valid and invalid tokens (parallelizable)

Scenarios:

Successful Sign-In:

Precondition: The user is on the sign-in interface.

User Action: The user enters valid Google credentials and submits the form.

Expected Outcome: The system successfully authenticates the user and redirects them to the main extension interface.

Postcondition: The user is logged in and can access premium features.

Invalid Credentials:

Precondition: The user is on the sign-in interface.

User Action: The user enters invalid Google credentials and submits the form.

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect.

Postcondition: The user is prompted to try again without losing their input.

Network Error:

Precondition: The user is on the sign-in interface.

User Action: The user submits the sign-in form, but there is a network issue.

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating a network error and suggests checking the connection.

Postcondition: The user is informed of the issue and can attempt to sign in again later.

Accessibility Check:

Precondition: The user is on the sign-in interface.

User Action: The user navigates the interface using a screen reader.

Expected Outcome: The screen reader accurately describes the interface elements and instructions.

Postcondition: The interface is confirmed to be accessible for users with disabilities.
