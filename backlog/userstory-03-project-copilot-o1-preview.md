Title: 

Provide Options for Saving Screenshot and Transcribed Text

Description:

User:
As a user of the Screenshot Enhancer extension

Action:
I want to choose options for saving the screenshot image and transcribed text

Outcome:
So that I can decide whether to save the screenshot, the transcribed text, or both according to my needs

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The extension provides clear options for choosing which content to save: the screenshot image, the transcribed text, or both.
2. Options are presented before the saving action, allowing the user to make a selection each time.
3. If the user selects only the image, the screenshot is saved without the transcribed text.
4. If the user selects only the text, the transcribed text is saved without the screenshot image.
5. If the user selects both, both the screenshot image and the transcribed text are saved.
6. The saved files are appropriately named and stored in the user's designated download folder.
7. The user can change default save preferences in the extension settings.
8. Error handling is in place for cases where saving fails, with appropriate error messages displayed to the user.

Technical Reference:

Frontend Development (Front-end Developer)
- Update the extension's save interface to include options for selecting which content to save.
- Design and implement clear, user-friendly UI elements (e.g., checkboxes or toggle switches) matching the extension's design.
- Implement logic to capture the user's selection and trigger the appropriate save actions.
- Provide visual confirmation of the selected options.
- Implement settings allowing users to set default save preferences.
- Implement error handling to display appropriate messages if saving fails.

Backend Development (Back-end Developer)
- Ensure compatibility with any backend services if applicable.
- Verify that saving mechanisms support separate and simultaneous saving of image and text files.

Integration (Full-stack Developer)
- Link the frontend options to the appropriate saving functions.
- Ensure that the correct files are saved based on the user's selection.
- Handle data formatting for the transcribed text (e.g., save as .txt or .docx files).
- Ensure images are saved in the correct format (e.g., .png, .jpeg).
- Test the complete workflow across different browsers and operating systems.

Implementation Steps:

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Design UI elements for save options selection.
   - Implement these UI elements in the extension interface.
   - Connect UI selections to the save functionality.
   - Update save functions to handle different content combinations.
   - Add settings for default save preferences.
   - Test UI for usability and consistency.

2. **Integration**:
   - Ensure selected content is correctly prepared and formatted for saving.
   - Implement simultaneous saving functionality when both options are selected.
   - Test the saving process for all combinations of selections.

3. **Error Handling and Testing**:
   - Implement error detection for saving failures.
   - Display user-friendly error messages with guidance.
   - Conduct QA testing for all scenarios.
   - Perform cross-browser and cross-platform testing.

Scenarios:

1. **User saves both screenshot and transcribed text**:
   - User captures content and selects both save options.
   - Both files are saved to the designated folder.

2. **User saves only the screenshot image**:
   - User captures content and selects the image only.
   - Only the image file is saved.

3. **User saves only the transcribed text**:
   - User captures content and selects the text only.
   - Only the text file is saved.

4. **User sets default preferences**:
   - User sets default to save both without prompting.
   - Subsequent saves automatically save both files.

5. **Error during saving process**:
   - User attempts to save content but encounters an error.
   - Extension displays an error message with possible solutions.
