Title: Text Preview Interface

Description:

User:
As a user of the Screenshot Enhancer extension

Action:
I want to see the transcribed text displayed alongside my captured screenshot

Outcome:
So that I can edit the text for accuracy and relevance, ensuring that the information presented is correct and useful.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should be able to view the transcribed text directly below the thumbnail of the captured screenshot in the extension interface.
2. The interface must accommodate various text lengths, ensuring that longer texts are displayed without truncation or overflow issues.
3. The user should have the ability to edit the transcribed text directly within the interface, with changes reflected in real-time.
4. The system should handle edge cases effectively, such as:
   - Displaying a placeholder message when no text is available.
   - Providing feedback for any errors encountered during transcription.
   - Ensuring that the interface remains responsive and user-friendly regardless of text length.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the text preview interface requires modifications to the front-end of the Screenshot Enhancer extension. The following subtasks are necessary to achieve this:

1. Design the Preview Interface (UX Designer)
   - Create a mockup of the interface that displays the screenshot and transcribed text.
   - Ensure the design is user-friendly and visually appealing, with clear editing options.

2. Implement Text Display Functionality (Front-end Developer)
   - Develop the functionality to display the transcribed text below the screenshot thumbnail.
   - Ensure that the text area is editable and updates in real-time as the user makes changes.

3. Handle Edge Cases (Front-end Developer)
   - Implement logic to manage scenarios where no text is available or where errors occur during transcription.
   - Ensure that the interface provides appropriate feedback to the user in these cases.

4. Test the Interface (QA Engineer)
   - Conduct testing to ensure that the text preview interface works correctly with various text lengths.
   - Validate that all acceptance criteria are met and that the interface is responsive and user-friendly.

Implementation Steps:

1. Design the Preview Interface:
   - Create mockups and finalize the design (sequential)
   - Review the design with stakeholders for feedback (sequential)

2. Implement Text Display Functionality:
   - Develop the text display and editing features (sequential)
   - Test the functionality with different text lengths (parallelizable)

3. Handle Edge Cases:
   - Implement error handling and feedback mechanisms (sequential)
   - Test edge cases to ensure robustness (parallelizable)

4. Test the Interface:
   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback (sequential)
   - Make necessary adjustments based on testing results (parallelizable)

The text preview interface can be implemented by a combination of front-end developers and UX designers, with testing conducted by the QA engineer to ensure a seamless user experience. The steps should be executed sequentially to maintain clarity and focus, with some testing steps being parallelizable to optimize the development timeline.

Scenarios:

1. Display Transcribed Text:
   - Precondition: The user has captured a screenshot and the voice input has been transcribed.
   - User Action: The user opens the Screenshot Enhancer extension.
   - Expected Outcome: The system displays the screenshot alongside the transcribed text for review.
   - Postcondition: The user can edit the text as needed.

2. Handle No Transcribed Text:
   - Precondition: The user has captured a screenshot, but no voice input was transcribed.
   - User Action: The user opens the Screenshot Enhancer extension.
   - Expected Outcome: The system displays a placeholder message indicating that no text is available.
   - Postcondition: The user is informed that they need to capture voice input for transcription.

3. Edit Transcribed Text:
   - Precondition: The system has displayed the transcribed text alongside the screenshot.
   - User Action: The user edits the transcribed text.
   - Expected Outcome: The system updates the displayed text in real-time as the user makes changes.
   - Postcondition: The user can see their edits reflected immediately.

4. Error Handling During Transcription:
   - Precondition: The user has captured a screenshot, but an error occurred during transcription.
   - User Action: The user opens the Screenshot Enhancer extension.
   - Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the issue and suggests corrective actions.
   - Postcondition: The user is informed of the error and can take steps to resolve it.

5. Performance Testing:
   - Precondition: The system is set up to display transcribed text and screenshots.
   - User Action: Multiple users simultaneously capture screenshots and transcribe voice input.
   - Expected Outcome: The system handles concurrent requests efficiently without significant delays.
   - Postcondition: The system's performance under load is validated.
