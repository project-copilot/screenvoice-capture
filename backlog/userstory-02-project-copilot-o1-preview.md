Title: 

Provide Preview and Editing Functionality for Transcribed Text

Description:

User:
As a user of the Screenshot Enhancer extension

Action:
I want to preview and edit the transcribed text alongside the screenshot within the extension

Outcome:
So that I can correct any transcription errors before saving

Acceptance Criteria:
1. After voice input is captured and transcribed, the extension displays the transcribed text in a preview interface alongside a thumbnail of the screenshot.
2. The user can view and edit the transcribed text directly within the preview interface.
3. The text preview interface supports various text lengths and provides a user-friendly text editor (e.g., with standard text editing features like cursor positioning, deletion, insertion).
4. Changes made by the user in the text editor are saved and reflected in the final output when saving.
5. The interface provides clear options to proceed to save or cancel the operation.
6. The preview works consistently across supported browsers and devices.
7. The design of the preview interface follows the application's UI/UX standards.

Technical Reference:

- **Frontend Development (Front-end Developer)**
  - Implement the preview interface in the extension popup to display the transcribed text alongside a thumbnail of the screenshot.
  - Design the interface to be responsive and user-friendly, supporting various text lengths.
  - Include a text editing component that allows users to edit the transcribed text.
  - Ensure the text editor supports basic text editing functionalities and handles edge cases (e.g., very long texts, special characters).
  - Provide options for users to save changes or cancel editing.
  - Ensure the interface visually aligns with the existing design language of the extension.
  - Handle any errors gracefully, such as issues displaying the text or image.

- **Backend Development (Back-end Developer)**
  - Confirm that the application architecture supports storing and retrieving the edited text.
  - Update any data models if necessary to include the edited text.
  - Ensure data persistence aligns with privacy and security guidelines.

- **Integration (Full-stack Developer)**
  - Ensure seamless integration of the text preview and editing functionality with existing voice capture and saving features.
  - Test the flow from voice capture to text editing to saving, ensuring data is passed correctly between components.
  - Implement error handling for scenarios where the transcribed text is unavailable or the image fails to load.
  - Optimize performance to prevent lag or delays in displaying the preview and editing interface.

Implementation Steps:

- **Frontend Development**:
  - Design the UI for the preview and editing interface, following UX guidelines.
  - Develop the component to display the screenshot thumbnail within the extension popup.
  - Develop the text editing component, ensuring it handles various text inputs and provides basic editing features.
  - Integrate the screenshot thumbnail and text editor into a cohesive preview interface.
  - Implement 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons with appropriate functionality.
  - Ensure the interface is responsive and functions correctly on different devices and screen sizes.
  - Conduct cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility.
  - Handle exceptions and edge cases, such as empty transcriptions or extremely long text inputs.

- **Backend Development**:
  - Verify that the existing architecture can handle the storage of edited text.
  - Modify data models if necessary to accommodate the edited transcription.
  - Ensure that any data storage complies with security and privacy policies.

- **Integration**:
  - Connect the preview and editing interface with the voice capture component to receive the transcribed text.
  - Ensure that the edited text is correctly passed to the saving functionality.
  - Perform end-to-end testing of the workflow from voice capture through editing to saving.
  - Implement error handling for data transfer between components.
  - Optimize the overall performance of the integrated features.

Scenarios:
1. **Happy Path**:
   - The user records a voice description.
   - The transcribed text appears alongside the screenshot in the preview interface.
   - The user edits the text to correct minor transcription errors.
   - The user saves the changes and proceeds to save both the edited text and screenshot.

2. **No Edits Needed**:
   - The user records a voice description.
   - The transcribed text is accurate.
   - The user previews the text and decides no edits are needed.
   - The user proceeds to save the text and screenshot without making changes.

3. **Editing Errors**:
   - The user records a voice description.
   - The transcribed text contains significant errors.
   - The user extensively edits the text.
   - The edited text is properly saved and reflected in the final output.

4. **Empty Transcription**:
   - The user records a voice description, but due to a microphone issue, no transcription is generated.
   - The preview interface notifies the user that no transcription is available.
   - The user is given options to retry the voice input or manually enter text.

5. **Cancellation**:
   - The user records a voice description.
   - In the preview interface, the user decides not to proceed.
   - The user cancels the operation.
   - No data is saved, and the user returns to the main extension interface.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - A network or system error occurs during text preview loading.
   - The interface displays an appropriate error message.
   - The user is prompted to retry or cancel the operation.
