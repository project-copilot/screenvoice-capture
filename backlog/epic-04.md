Title:

Convert Voice-to-Text Feature to Premium Tier

Description:

Objective:
The primary goal of this issue is to transition the voice-to-text conversion feature of the Chrome extension to a premium tier, thereby enhancing the value of the subscription model. This upgrade aims to provide users with a clear distinction between free and premium functionalities, encouraging subscriptions while maintaining a robust user experience for non-paying users.

Scope:
This issue encompasses several critical tasks:

UI Modification: Update the user interface to clearly indicate which features are premium, ensuring that users can easily identify the voice-to-text functionality as a paid feature.

Feature Gating Implementation: Develop a mechanism to restrict access to the voice-to-text feature based on the user's subscription status, ensuring that only users with an active premium subscription can utilize this functionality.

Subscription Status Validation: Integrate checks within the extension to verify the user's subscription status before allowing access to premium features, enhancing security and user experience.

Documentation Update: Revise user documentation and help resources to reflect the changes in feature availability and guide users on how to subscribe for premium access.

Acceptance Criteria:

The voice-to-text feature is only accessible to users with an active premium subscription.

The UI clearly differentiates between free and premium features, with appropriate messaging for users who attempt to access premium functionalities without a subscription.

Successful integration of subscription status checks that prevent unauthorized access to the voice-to-text feature.

Updated documentation is available, providing clear instructions on how to subscribe and access premium features.

Implementation Strategy:
The implementation will follow an Agile approach, allowing for iterative development and testing. The strategy includes:

Initial UI design and prototyping to gather feedback from stakeholders.

Development of the feature gating mechanism and subscription validation logic.

Comprehensive testing to ensure that the feature gating works as intended and that the user experience remains seamless.

Rollout of the updated extension version to a subset of users for beta testing before a full launch.

Dependencies:

Collaboration with the development team to ensure proper integration of the subscription management system.

Coordination with the UX/UI design team to create an intuitive interface that clearly communicates premium features.

Integration with the Stripe API for managing subscriptions and validating user access.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

User Confusion: To mitigate potential confusion regarding feature access, clear messaging will be implemented in the UI, and user documentation will be updated accordingly.

Technical Challenges: Regular testing and code reviews will be conducted to identify and resolve any technical issues early in the development process.

Subscription Management Issues: Close monitoring of the integration with the Stripe API will be essential to ensure that subscription status is accurately reflected in the extension.
