Title:

Convert Voice-to-Text Feature to Premium

Description:

Objective:
Transform the voice-to-text conversion feature into a premium offering within the Chrome extension, ensuring that only subscribed users can access this functionality. This upgrade aims to enhance user experience while generating revenue through premium subscriptions.

Scope:

Update the voice-to-text conversion feature to be part of the premium tier.

Implement UI changes to clearly indicate premium features to users.

Develop feature gating mechanisms to restrict access to voice-to-text for non-subscribed users.

Integrate Stripe for subscription management, allowing users to create and manage their subscriptions seamlessly.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users must receive a notification indicating that voice-to-text is a premium feature.

The UI must reflect the premium status of the voice-to-text feature.

Feature gating must be implemented, preventing non-subscribed users from accessing the voice-to-text functionality.

Subscription management must be integrated with Stripe, allowing users to subscribe and manage their premium access easily.

Implementation Strategy:

Update the UI to include indicators for premium features, specifically for voice-to-text.

Implement feature gating on both the client and server sides to ensure secure access control.

Integrate Stripe for subscription management, including the creation of a Customer Portal for users to manage their subscriptions.

Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the feature gating and subscription management work as intended.

Milestones:

UI design and implementation for premium features.

Development of feature gating mechanisms.

Integration of Stripe for subscription management.

Testing and validation of the entire flow from subscription to feature access.

Dependencies:

Successful integration with the Stripe API for subscription management.

Updates to the backend to support feature gating based on subscription status.

Coordination with the design team for UI updates.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

Risk of user confusion regarding premium features: Provide clear notifications and UI indicators.

Potential issues with Stripe integration: Conduct thorough testing and have a rollback plan in place.

User resistance to subscription model: Offer a trial period or promotional pricing to encourage adoption.
