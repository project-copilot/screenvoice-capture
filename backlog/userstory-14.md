User Story

Title:

Subscription Status Validation Integration

Description:

As a developer, I want to integrate checks within the Chrome extension to verify the user's subscription status before allowing access to premium features, enhancing security and user experience.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Chrome extension should check the user's subscription status stored in the database before enabling any premium features.

If the user does not have an active subscription, the extension should display a message indicating that premium features are unavailable and provide a link to the subscription management page.

The system should validate the subscription status on the server-side for all API calls related to premium features to ensure security.

The extension should cache the subscription status locally to minimize API calls, refreshing the status at regular intervals or upon user action.

Technical Reference:

Implement Subscription Status Check (Frontend Developer)

Integrate a function in the Chrome extension to retrieve the user's subscription status from local storage.

If the status is not available, make an API call to the backend to fetch the current subscription status.

Display appropriate messages based on the subscription status.

Server-Side Validation (Backend Developer)

Create an API endpoint to validate the user's subscription status against the database.

Ensure that all API calls for premium features check the user's subscription status before processing the request.

User Interface Updates (Frontend Developer)

Update the UI to reflect the availability of premium features based on the user's subscription status.

Ensure that the messaging is clear and guides users on how to manage their subscriptions.

Implementation Steps:

Implement Subscription Status Check:

Develop the function to check local storage and make API calls as needed (sequential).

Test the subscription status retrieval process (parallelizable).

Server-Side Validation:

Create the API endpoint for subscription validation (sequential).

Test the endpoint with various user scenarios (parallelizable).

User Interface Updates:

Design and implement UI changes to reflect subscription status (sequential).

Conduct user testing to ensure clarity and usability of messages (parallelizable).

This integration will ensure that users can only access premium features if they have an active subscription, thereby enhancing both security and user experience within the Chrome extension.
