User Story

Title:

Implement Feature Gating for Voice-to-Text

Description:

As a developer, I want to implement feature gating for the voice-to-text functionality in the Chrome extension, ensuring that only users with an active premium subscription can access this feature.

Outcome:
This will allow us to restrict access to premium features, enhancing the value of the subscription model and ensuring that users are incentivized to maintain their subscriptions.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should check the user's subscription status before enabling the voice-to-text feature in the Chrome extension.

If the user does not have an active premium subscription, the voice-to-text feature should be disabled, and a message should inform the user of the requirement.

The subscription status should be validated on both the client-side (for immediate feedback) and server-side (for security).

The system should provide a seamless experience for users to upgrade their subscription if they wish to access the voice-to-text feature.

Technical Reference:

Implement Client-Side Subscription Check:

Modify the Chrome extension to check local storage for the user's subscription status before enabling the voice-to-text feature.

Display a message to users without an active subscription, guiding them on how to upgrade.

Implement Server-Side Subscription Validation:

Create an API endpoint to validate the user's subscription status against the database.

Ensure that all API calls related to the voice-to-text feature are validated on the server.

Update User Interface:

Design and implement UI changes to reflect the gating of the voice-to-text feature based on subscription status.

Ensure that the UI provides clear instructions for users on how to subscribe to premium features.

Implementation Steps:

Implement Client-Side Subscription Check:

Modify the extension to check local storage for subscription status (sequential).

Display appropriate messages based on subscription status (sequential).

Implement Server-Side Subscription Validation:

Create the API endpoint for subscription validation (sequential).

Test the endpoint to ensure accurate subscription status retrieval (parallelizable).

Update User Interface:

Design the UI changes for the voice-to-text feature (sequential).

Implement and test the UI changes to ensure clarity and usability (parallelizable).
