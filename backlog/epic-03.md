Title:

Integrate Stripe for Subscription Management

Description:

Objective:
The primary goal of this epic is to integrate Stripe for subscription management within the Chrome extension, enabling users to easily create and manage their subscriptions for accessing premium features. This integration aims to provide a seamless user experience while ensuring secure payment processing and real-time synchronization of subscription statuses.

Scope:
This epic encompasses several critical initiatives:

Stripe Customer Portal Integration: Implement a session creation process that allows users to access the Stripe Customer Portal for managing their subscriptions.

Subscription Management via Webhooks: Set up webhooks to handle subscription creation, updates, and cancellations, ensuring that the backend remains in sync with Stripe's subscription status.

Real-Time Subscription Status Validation: Develop mechanisms to validate subscription status in real-time, ensuring users can only access premium features if they have an active subscription.

User Interface Updates: Modify the Chrome extension's UI to reflect subscription options and premium features, providing clear information to users about their subscription status.

Acceptance Criteria:

Successful integration of the Stripe Customer Portal, allowing users to create and manage subscriptions without issues.

Webhooks are correctly set up and tested, ensuring that subscription changes are accurately reflected in the backend.

Users can access premium features only if their subscription is active, with appropriate error messages displayed for inactive subscriptions.

Positive user feedback regarding the subscription management experience through surveys.

Implementation Strategy:
The implementation will follow an Agile approach, with features developed in iterative cycles. The integration will begin with the Stripe Customer Portal, followed by webhook setup and UI updates. Continuous testing will be conducted to ensure functionality and user experience are optimized based on feedback.

Milestones:

Research and Planning: Analyze user needs and preferences regarding subscription management to inform the integration process.

Development and Testing: Implement the Stripe integration and webhooks, followed by thorough testing to ensure reliability and performance.

Launch and Evaluation: Roll out the subscription management features to users, monitor engagement, and gather feedback for future improvements.

Dependencies:

Collaboration between the development team, UX/UI designers, and the Stripe API documentation.

Integration with existing backend systems to ensure seamless data flow and user experience.

Ongoing support from Stripe for any technical issues encountered during integration.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

User Confusion: Provide clear documentation and in-app guidance to help users navigate the subscription process.

Technical Challenges: Conduct extensive testing and have contingency plans in place for potential integration issues.

Security Concerns: Implement best practices for handling sensitive payment information and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
