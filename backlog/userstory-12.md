User Story

Title:

UI Modification for Premium Features

Description:

As a user of the Chrome extension,  
I want the user interface to clearly indicate which features are premium,  
So that I can easily identify the voice-to-text functionality as a paid feature.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user interface should have distinct visual indicators (e.g., icons, labels) to differentiate premium features from free features.

The voice-to-text functionality must be marked as a premium feature, with a clear message indicating that it requires a subscription.

Users should be able to access a tooltip or help section that explains the benefits of premium features and how to subscribe.

The UI should be responsive and maintain clarity across different screen sizes and resolutions.

Any attempt to access the voice-to-text feature without a valid subscription should prompt the user with a message explaining the need for a subscription.

Technical Reference:

Update UI Components (Frontend Developer)

Modify the existing UI to include visual indicators for premium features.

Ensure that the voice-to-text functionality is clearly labeled as premium.
