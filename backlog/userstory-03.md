Title: Content Saving Functionality

Description:

User:
As a user of the Screenshot Enhancer extension

Action:
I want to save my screenshot and transcribed text as separate files, so that I can choose what to saveâ€”either the image, the text, or both.

Outcome:
So that I can manage my saved content effectively and have the flexibility to keep only what I need.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should see checkboxes in the save interface to select whether to save the screenshot, the transcribed text, or both.
2. The system should allow the user to save the selected content in appropriate file formats (e.g., PNG for images, TXT for text).
3. The interface should provide clear feedback on the saving process, including success or error messages.
4. The system should handle scenarios where the user attempts to save without making a selection, prompting them to choose at least one option.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the content saving functionality will require updates to the existing save feature in the Screenshot Enhancer extension. This includes modifications to the user interface and the underlying logic to handle file saving.

1. Update Save Interface (Front-end Developer)
   - Design and implement checkboxes for selecting content types (screenshot, text) in the save dialog.
   - Ensure the interface is intuitive and visually clear, providing users with guidance on their options.
   - Test the interface for usability and accessibility, ensuring it meets design standards.

2. Implement File Saving Logic (Back-end Developer)
   - Extend the existing save functionality to handle multiple file types based on user selection.
   - Ensure that the correct file format is used for each type of content (e.g., PNG for screenshots, TXT for text).
   - Implement error handling for file saving operations, including scenarios where the file cannot be saved.

3. Provide User Feedback (Front-end Developer)
   - Implement success and error messages to inform users about the outcome of their save actions.
   - Ensure that feedback is timely and does not disrupt the user experience.
   - Test the feedback mechanism to confirm it works under various scenarios (successful save, failed save, no selection).

Implementation Steps:
1. Update Save Interface:
   - Design and implement the checkbox selection (sequential)
   - Test the interface for usability and accessibility (parallelizable)
2. Implement File Saving Logic:
   - Extend the save functionality to handle multiple file types (sequential)
   - Implement error handling for file saving operations (sequential)
3. Provide User Feedback:
   - Implement success and error messages (sequential)
   - Test the feedback mechanism (parallelizable)

The content saving functionality can be implemented by a front-end developer and a back-end developer working collaboratively. The steps should be executed sequentially to ensure a cohesive user experience, with some testing steps being parallelizable to optimize the development timeline.

Scenarios:
1. Save Content - Both Options Selected:
   - Precondition: The user has captured a screenshot and transcribed text.
   - User Action: The user selects both checkboxes and clicks the save button.
   - Expected Outcome: The system saves both the screenshot and the transcribed text in the specified formats.
   - Postcondition: The user receives a success message confirming the save.

2. Save Content - Only Screenshot Selected:
   - Precondition: The user has captured a screenshot and transcribed text.
   - User Action: The user selects only the screenshot checkbox and clicks the save button.
   - Expected Outcome: The system saves the screenshot in the specified format.
   - Postcondition: The user receives a success message confirming the save.

3. Save Content - No Selection Made:
   - Precondition: The user has captured a screenshot and transcribed text.
   - User Action: The user clicks the save button without selecting any checkboxes.
   - Expected Outcome: The system prompts the user to select at least one option before proceeding.
   - Postcondition: The user is informed of the requirement to make a selection.

4. Handle Save Error:
   - Precondition: The user has made a selection and clicked the save button.
   - User Action: The system encounters an error while attempting to save the file.
   - Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the failure and suggests possible actions (e.g., retry).
   - Postcondition: The user is informed of the error and can take corrective actions.
