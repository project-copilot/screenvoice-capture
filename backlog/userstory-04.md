User Story

Title:

Google Account Sign-In

Description:

User:
As a user of the Chrome extension

Action:
I want to sign in using my Google account

Outcome:
So that I can access the extension securely and manage my subscriptions effectively

Acceptance Criteria:

The Chrome extension provides a 'Sign in with Google' button on the login screen.

Clicking the button initiates the Google Sign-In process using the Chrome Identity API.

Upon successful sign-in, the extension sends the Google token to the backend for validation.

The backend validates the token with the Google Auth API and creates or updates the user record in the database.

A session token is issued to the user upon successful validation, allowing access to the extension.

If the sign-in fails, an appropriate error message is displayed to the user.

Technical Reference:

Frontend Development:

Implement the 'Sign in with Google' button using the Chrome Identity API.

Handle user feedback for both successful and failed sign-in attempts.

Backend Development:

Create an API endpoint (POST /auth/google) to validate the Google token and manage user sessions.

Ensure secure storage of session tokens and user data.

Integration:

Test the integration between the Chrome extension and the backend for seamless authentication.

Implement error handling for token validation failures and network issues.

Scenarios:

Happy Path:

User clicks 'Sign in with Google', successfully signs in, and accesses the extension.

Token Validation Failure:

User clicks 'Sign in with Google', but the token validation fails, and an error message is displayed.

Network Error:

User attempts to sign in during a network interruption, and the system prompts the user to try again later.
