User Story

Title:

Configure Google OAuth Process

Description:

As a developer, I want to configure the Google OAuth process to facilitate user authentication through their Google accounts, ensuring that users can securely sign in before accessing premium features.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Chrome extension should initiate the Google Sign-In process using the Chrome Identity API.

Upon successful sign-in, the extension must send the obtained Google token to the backend server for validation.

The backend server should validate the Google token with the Google Auth API and create or update the user record in the database.

A session token must be issued to the user upon successful validation, allowing access to premium features.

The system should handle token validation errors gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

Technical Reference:

Implement Google Sign-In in the Chrome extension:

Utilize the Chrome Identity API to initiate the sign-in process.

Ensure the extension requests the necessary scopes for user data access.

Handle the sign-in response and extract the Google token.

Validate Google token on the backend:

Set up an endpoint to receive the Google token from the Chrome extension.

Implement logic to validate the token with the Google Auth API.

Create or update the user record in the database based on the token validation response.

Issue session token:

Generate a session token upon successful user validation.

Store the session token securely and ensure it is sent back to the Chrome extension for future requests.

Implementation Steps:

Implement Google Sign-In in the Chrome extension (sequential).

Validate Google token on the backend (sequential).

Issue session token (sequential).

Scenarios:

User initiates Google Sign-In:

Precondition: The user is on the Chrome extension login page.

User Action: The user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.

Expected Outcome: The Google Sign-In process is initiated.

Postcondition: The user is prompted to select their Google account.

Successful token validation:

Precondition: The user has signed in successfully.

User Action: The backend receives the Google token.

Expected Outcome: The token is validated, and the user record is created or updated.

Postcondition: The user is issued a session token.

Token validation error:

Precondition: The user attempts to sign in, but the token is invalid.

User Action: The backend receives an invalid token.

Expected Outcome: The system returns an error message indicating the validation failure.

Postcondition: The user is informed of the error and can attempt to sign in again.
