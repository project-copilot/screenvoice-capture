Title: 

Enable Voice Input for Screenshot Descriptions

Description:

User:
As a user of the Screenshot Enhancer extension

Action:
I want to record voice input by clicking a button in the extension popup

Outcome:
So that I can add descriptions to screenshots using my voice

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The extension popup includes a clearly visible 'Record Voice' button.
2. Clicking the 'Record Voice' button activates voice recording using the Web Speech API.
3. While recording, the button indicates the recording status (e.g., changes color or shows an animation).
4. The system captures the user's voice input and converts it to text.
5. The transcribed text is displayed to the user for preview and editing.
6. If the browser does not support the Web Speech API, the user is notified accordingly.
7. If the user denies microphone permissions, an appropriate error message is displayed.
8. The feature gracefully handles errors such as no microphone access, network issues, and unrecognized speech.

Technical Reference:

- **Frontend Development (Front-end Developer)**
  - **Implement 'Record Voice' Button**
    - Add a clearly visible 'Record Voice' button to the extension popup UI.
    - Ensure the button is accessible and intuitive for users.
  - **Visual Recording Indicators**
    - Style the button to reflect recording status (e.g., change color or show an animation when recording is active).
    - Provide visual feedback when the system is processing speech and when results are final.
  - **Integrate Web Speech API**
    - Check for browser support of `webkitSpeechRecognition`.
      - If not supported, notify the user that their browser does not support voice input.
    - Request microphone permissions from the user.
      - Handle the user's response appropriately.
      - If permissions are denied, display an error message indicating that microphone access is required.
    - Create a `webkitSpeechRecognition` object to capture voice input.
    - Configure recognition settings:
      - `recognition.continuous = false;` (stop automatically after speech is recognized)
      - `recognition.interimResults = true;` (provide real-time transcription)
    - Implement event handlers:
      - `onstart`: Indicate that recording has started.
      - `onresult`: Process interim and final transcribed text.
      - `onerror`: Handle errors such as network issues or no speech detected.
      - `onend`: Reset the interface when recording ends.
  - **Display Transcribed Text**
    - Show the transcribed text in the extension popup below the 'Record Voice' button.
    - Allow the user to preview and edit the text as needed.
  - **Error Handling**
    - Provide user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios.
    - Handle cases where no speech is detected or speech is unrecognized.
  - **Testing and Validation**
    - Test the feature across supported browsers and devices.
    - Ensure accessibility compliance, including screen reader compatibility.

- **Backend Development (Back-end Developer)**
  - No backend development is required for this feature unless future enhancements involve server-side processing or data storage.
  - Ensure compliance with privacy policies regarding voice data if backend integration becomes necessary.

- **Integration (Full-stack Developer)**
  - **Integrate with Existing Features**
    - Ensure the voice input functionality integrates seamlessly with the screenshot capture and description features.
    - Confirm that the transcribed text can be saved along with the screenshot.
  - **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
    - Test the feature on all supported browsers and handle compatibility issues.
    - Provide fallbacks or notifications for unsupported browsers.
  - **Edge Case Handling**
    - Address potential edge cases, such as rapid toggling of the recording button.
    - Ensure the extension remains stable under unexpected user interactions.
  - **Security and Privacy Considerations**
    - Ensure that microphone access and voice data are handled securely.
    - Adhere to privacy policies and guidelines for handling user data.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Front-end Development**
   - Add the 'Record Voice' button to the extension popup UI.
     - Place it prominently for easy access.
   - Implement browser support check for `webkitSpeechRecognition`.
     - Use feature detection to determine API availability.
     - Notify the user if not supported.
   - Configure the Web Speech API:
     - Set up the `SpeechRecognition` object with appropriate settings.
     - Handle events for start, result, error, and end.
   - Style the recording button to indicate status:
     - Use CSS classes to change appearance during recording.
     - Consider adding animations or icons for clarity.
   - Implement permission requests and handling:
     - Prompt the user for microphone access when needed.
     - Provide clear instructions if access is denied.
   - Display the transcribed text in real-time:
     - Update the UI with interim results for immediate feedback.
     - Allow editing of the final transcribed text.
   - Handle errors and edge cases:
     - Implement timeouts for no speech detected.
     - Provide feedback for unrecognized speech.
   - Test the feature extensively:
     - Cover different accents, speech patterns, and noise conditions.
     - Ensure the UI behaves correctly in all scenarios.

2. **Integration**
   - Ensure the transcribed text is correctly associated with the captured screenshot.
   - Update the saving functionality to include the transcribed and edited text.
   - Test the full user flow from voice input to saving the screenshot with the description.
   - Verify that existing features are not adversely affected by the new functionality.
   - Perform cross-browser testing and address any issues discovered.

**Scenarios:**

1. **Successful Voice Recording and Transcription**
   - User clicks the 'Record Voice' button.
   - Microphone permission is granted.
   - Recording starts, and the button indicates active recording.
   - User speaks, and the system transcribes speech to text in real-time.
   - Transcribed text is displayed for user preview and editing.

2. **Browser Does Not Support Web Speech API**
   - User clicks the 'Record Voice' button.
   - System detects lack of support for `webkitSpeechRecognition`.
   - User is notified that voice input is not supported in their browser.
   - User is encouraged to update their browser or try a supported one.

3. **Microphone Permission Denied**
   - User clicks the 'Record Voice' button.
   - Browser prompts for microphone access; user denies permission.
   - Recording does not start.
   - System displays an error message explaining that microphone access is required.
   - User is instructed on how to enable permissions if desired.

4. **No Speech Detected**
   - User clicks the 'Record Voice' button.
   - Recording starts but the user does not speak.
   - After a defined timeout, recording stops automatically.
   - System notifies the user that no speech was detected.

5. **Unrecognized Speech**
   - User speaks but the speech is not recognized (e.g., due to background noise).
   - System handles the lack of transcription gracefully.
   - User is prompted to try again in a quieter environment.

6. **Network Error During Recognition**
   - Network issues occur during speech recognition.
   - `onerror` event is triggered.
   - System displays an error message informing the user of network issues.
   - User is advised to check their connection and try again.

7. **User Cancels Recording**
   - User starts recording but decides to cancel before speaking.
   - User clicks the 'Record Voice' button again to stop recording.
   - Recording stops, and no transcription is performed.
   - System returns to the idle state ready for another interaction.
