User Story

Title:

Implement Real-Time Subscription Status Validation

Description:

As a user, I want the system to validate my subscription status in real-time so that I can only access premium features if I have an active subscription.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should check the user's subscription status each time they attempt to access a premium feature.

If the user has an active subscription, they should be granted access to the premium features.

If the user does not have an active subscription, the system should display a message indicating that they need to subscribe to access premium features.

The subscription status should be retrieved from the backend server, which maintains the current status based on Stripe webhook notifications.

Technical Reference:

Implement Real-Time Subscription Status Check (Backend Developer)

Create an API endpoint to retrieve the current subscription status for the authenticated user.

Ensure that the endpoint validates the user's session token before returning the subscription status.

Test the endpoint to confirm it accurately reflects the user's subscription status based on the latest data from Stripe.

Integrate Subscription Status Check in Chrome Extension (Frontend Developer)

Modify the Chrome extension to call the new API endpoint whenever a user attempts to access a premium feature.

Implement error handling to manage scenarios where the subscription status cannot be retrieved (e.g., network issues).

Test the integration to ensure that the user experience is seamless and that the correct messages are displayed based on subscription status.

Update User Interface for Premium Features (UI/UX Designer)

Design and implement user interface changes to clearly indicate which features are premium and require an active subscription.

Ensure that the messaging for subscription status is clear and user-friendly.

Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the new interface and make necessary adjustments.
