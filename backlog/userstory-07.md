User Story

Title:

Handle Subscription Updates via Webhooks

Description:

User:
As a developer integrating Stripe with the Chrome extension

Action:
I want to handle subscription updates via Stripe webhooks

Outcome:
So that user records remain in sync and accurately reflect their subscription status

Acceptance Criteria:

The backend server receives webhook notifications from Stripe for subscription events (e.g., creation, updates, cancellations).

The server processes these webhook events to update the user subscription records in the database.

The system validates the subscription status each time a user attempts to access premium features.

Appropriate error handling is implemented for failed webhook notifications, including retries and logging.

Documentation is provided for the webhook integration process, including security measures (e.g., verifying webhook signatures).

Technical Reference:

Implement a webhook endpoint on the backend to receive notifications from Stripe.

Use Stripe's official libraries to handle webhook events and verify their authenticity.

Update the database schema if necessary to accommodate any new fields related to subscription status.

Ensure that the webhook processing logic is idempotent to handle duplicate events gracefully.

Set up monitoring and alerting for webhook failures to ensure timely resolution of issues.

Scenarios:

Happy Path:

A user creates a subscription through the Stripe Customer Portal, and the webhook notification is received and processed successfully, updating the user's record.

Subscription Update:

A user upgrades their subscription, and the webhook notification reflects this change, updating the database accordingly.

Subscription Cancellation:

A user cancels their subscription, and the webhook notification triggers the appropriate updates in the user record, preventing access to premium features.

Webhook Failure:

The server fails to process a webhook notification due to a temporary issue, and the system retries the processing after a defined interval, logging the failure for review.
