User Story

Title:

Establish Session Management System

Description:

As a developer, I want to establish a session management system that maintains user login status and handles session expiration appropriately, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system should allow users to log in using Google authentication, validating their credentials securely.

Upon successful login, the system should create a session token that persists until the user logs out or the session expires.

The session should automatically expire after a predefined period of inactivity, prompting the user to log in again.

The system should provide a mechanism for users to manually log out, invalidating their session token immediately.

The user interface should clearly indicate the login status and provide feedback during the login and logout processes.

Technical Reference:

Implement Google Authentication (Frontend Developer)

Integrate Google Sign-In using the Chrome Identity API to initiate the authentication process.

Send the obtained Google token to the backend for validation.

Handle authentication errors gracefully, providing user-friendly messages.

Create Session Management Logic (Backend Developer)

Validate the Google token with the Google Auth API and create a session token upon successful validation.

Store session tokens securely, ensuring they are associated with the correct user account.

Implement session expiration logic based on inactivity, including a configurable timeout period.

Develop Logout Functionality (Frontend and Backend Developer)

Create a logout endpoint that invalidates the session token on the server.

Update the user interface to reflect the logged-out state and provide feedback to the user.

Implementation Steps:

Implement Google Authentication:

Set up Google Sign-In and token validation (sequential)

Handle authentication errors and test the process (sequential)

Create Session Management Logic:

Implement session token creation and storage (sequential)

Develop session expiration logic (sequential)

Test session management under various scenarios (parallelizable)

Develop Logout Functionality:

Create and test the logout endpoint (sequential)

Update the user interface for logout feedback (sequential)

Scenarios:

User Login:

Precondition: The user is on the login page of the Chrome extension.

User Action: The user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button.

Expected Outcome: The system initiates the Google authentication process and retrieves the user's information upon success.

Postcondition: The user is logged in and redirected to the main interface.

Session Expiration:

Precondition: The user is logged in and has been inactive for the defined timeout period.

User Action: The user attempts to access a feature after the timeout.

Expected Outcome: The system prompts the user to log in again due to session expiration.

Postcondition: The user is redirected to the login page.

User Logout:

Precondition: The user is logged in and on the main interface.

User Action: The user clicks the "Logout" button.

Expected Outcome: The system invalidates the session token and updates the user interface to reflect the logged-out state.

Postcondition: The user is logged out and can no longer access premium features without logging in again.
