## Epic: Implement Voice-to-Text Functionality

**Description:**  
Enable users to add voice descriptions to their screenshots by capturing voice input, previewing and editing the transcribed text, and saving the content as needed.

## Additional Notes and Considerations

- **Language Support:**
  - Set `recognition.lang` to support multiple languages as needed.
  - Provide a language selection option if necessary.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure that all new UI elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
  - Provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles.

- **Privacy and Permissions:**
  - Inform users about microphone usage and data handling.
  - Reference the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper for compliance.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Append only new final transcripts to improve efficiency.
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders of the UI components.

- **Visual Feedback Enhancements:**
  - Consider adding a visual waveform or volume indicator during recording.
  - Provide real-time feedback on speech recognition progress.

## Timeline Estimates

- **Sprint 1:**
  - Complete User Story 1 (Voice Capture) and User Story 2 (Text Preview).
  - Finalize designs and initial implementation.
  - Conduct preliminary testing and resolve major bugs.

- **Sprint 2:**
  - Complete User Story 3 (Content Saving).
  - Perform comprehensive testing across all user stories.
  - Address edge cases and finalize error handling.
