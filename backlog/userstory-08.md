User Story

Title:

Integrate Stripe Customer Portal

Description:

As a user of the Chrome extension,  
I want to access the Stripe Customer Portal from the extension,  
So that I can create and manage my subscriptions seamlessly and unlock premium features.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user should be able to initiate the subscription process from the Chrome extension.

The system should create a Stripe Customer Portal session when the user requests to manage their subscription.

The Chrome extension should open the Stripe Customer Portal in a new tab for the user to create or manage their subscription.

The backend should handle Stripe webhooks to synchronize subscription status and update the userâ€™s subscription information in the database.

The system should validate the user's subscription status before allowing access to premium features.

Technical Reference:

Create Stripe Customer Portal Session (Backend Developer)

Implement an API endpoint to create a Stripe Customer Portal session.

Ensure the endpoint validates the user's authentication and retrieves the necessary subscription details.

Test the session creation process to ensure it works correctly with valid and invalid user data.

Handle Stripe Webhooks (Backend Developer)

Set up webhook endpoints to receive events from Stripe regarding subscription changes.

Implement logic to update the user's subscription status in the database based on the webhook events.

Test the webhook handling to ensure it processes events accurately and updates the database accordingly.

Validate Subscription Status (Frontend Developer)

Implement logic in the Chrome extension to check the user's subscription status before enabling premium features.

Ensure that the extension provides clear feedback to the user regarding their subscription status.

Test the validation process to ensure it accurately reflects the user's current subscription status.
