User Story

Title:

Update Chrome Extension UI for Subscription Management

Description:

As a user of the Chrome extension,  
I want the UI to clearly display my subscription options and premium features,  
So that I can easily understand my subscription status and access the features I have paid for.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user should be able to view their current subscription status prominently on the extension's main interface.

The UI should clearly differentiate between free and premium features, indicating which features are accessible based on the user's subscription.

The subscription management section should provide options to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel the subscription, linking to the Stripe Customer Portal for seamless management.

The UI should reflect real-time updates based on the user's subscription status, ensuring that any changes made in the Stripe Customer Portal are accurately displayed in the extension.

The design should be user-friendly and consistent with the overall aesthetic of the Chrome extension.
