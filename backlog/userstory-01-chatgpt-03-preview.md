### User Story 3: Content Saving

**As a** user  
**I want** to save the screenshot and/or the transcribed text as separate files  
**So that** I can use them according to my needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Save Options UI:**
  - Checkboxes are provided for "Save Image," "Save Text," or "Save Both."
  - Options are clearly labeled and easy to understand.
- **Saving Functionality:**
  - When "Save Image" is selected, the screenshot is saved in its default image format.
  - When "Save Text" is selected, the transcribed text is saved as a `.txt` file.
  - If both are selected, both files are saved appropriately.
- **File Handling:**
  - Files are saved to the user's designated download location.
  - File names are autogenerated with a timestamp or allow user input.
- **Error Handling:**
  - The system provides feedback if saving fails (e.g., due to permissions or disk space).
  - Ensures that partial saves do not occur; both files must save successfully if both are selected.

**Tasks:**

1. **Design Save Options UI:**
   - Add checkboxes or toggle switches for save options in the extension popup.
   - Ensure the UI is intuitive and accessible.

2. **Extend Save Functionality:**
   - Modify existing save logic to handle multiple file types.
   - Implement separate functions for saving images and text files.

3. **Implement File Naming Conventions:**
   - Use a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`).
   - Allow users to rename files before saving if feasible.

4. **Develop Error Handling Mechanisms:**
   - Check for and handle exceptions during the save process.
   - Provide user feedback on success or failure of file saves.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Test saving in different browsers and operating systems.
   - Ensure files are saved correctly and are accessible.
