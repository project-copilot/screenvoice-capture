User Story

Title: Voice Capture Feature

Description:

User:
As a user of the Screenshot Enhancer extension

Action:
I want to have a button that activates the Web Speech API for recording my voice

Outcome:
So that I can easily capture voice input for my screenshots

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should see a clearly labeled button in the Screenshot Enhancer extension that activates voice recording.
2. When the button is clicked, the Web Speech API should start recording the user's voice.
3. The button should provide visual feedback (e.g., color change or animation) indicating that recording is in progress.
4. The system should handle errors gracefully, displaying appropriate messages for unsupported browsers or microphone permission issues.
5. The application should request microphone permissions if not previously granted, and handle cases where the user denies access.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the voice capture feature requires integration with the Web Speech API. The following subtasks outline the necessary steps:

1. **Button Implementation (Front-end Developer)**
   - Create a button in the extension popup that activates the voice recording feature.
   - Ensure the button is visually distinct and accessible.

2. **Web Speech API Integration (Front-end Developer)**
   - Check for browser support for the Web Speech API using the appropriate feature detection.
   - Implement the SpeechRecognition object to start capturing audio when the button is clicked.
   - Set up event handlers for `onstart`, `onresult`, `onerror`, and `onend` to manage the recording process and handle results.

3. **Visual Feedback Mechanism (Front-end Developer)**
   - Implement visual feedback for the button during recording, such as changing its color or adding an animation.
   - Ensure that the feedback is clear and intuitive for users.

4. **Error Handling (Front-end Developer)**
   - Implement error handling for scenarios where the browser does not support the Web Speech API or when microphone permissions are denied.
   - Display user-friendly error messages to guide users in resolving issues.

Implementation Steps:

1. Implement the button in the extension popup (sequential)
2. Integrate the Web Speech API and set up event handlers (sequential)
3. Add visual feedback for the recording button (sequential)
4. Implement error handling for unsupported browsers and permission issues (sequential)

The voice capture feature can be implemented by a front-end developer familiar with JavaScript and the Web Speech API. The steps should be executed sequentially to ensure a smooth user experience.

Scenarios:

1. **Activate Voice Capture:**
   - Precondition: The user has the Screenshot Enhancer extension installed.
   - User Action: The user clicks the voice capture button.
   - Expected Outcome: The system starts recording the user's voice and provides visual feedback.
   - Postcondition: The user is aware that their voice is being recorded.

2. **Handle Unsupported Browser:**
   - Precondition: The user clicks the voice capture button in an unsupported browser.
   - User Action: The system checks for Web Speech API support.
   - Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating that the feature is not supported.
   - Postcondition: The user is informed of the limitation.

3. **Handle Microphone Permission Denial:**
   - Precondition: The user clicks the voice capture button without granting microphone permissions.
   - User Action: The system requests microphone access.
   - Expected Outcome: If the user denies access, an error message is displayed.
   - Postcondition: The user understands that they need to grant permission to use the feature.

4. **Successful Voice Recording:**
   - Precondition: The user has granted microphone permissions.
   - User Action: The user clicks the voice capture button.
   - Expected Outcome: The system records the voice input and provides visual feedback during the process.
   - Postcondition: The user can proceed to use the captured voice input as needed.
