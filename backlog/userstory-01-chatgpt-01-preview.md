### User Story 1: Voice Capture

**As a** user  
**I want** to record voice input using the extension  
**So that** I can transcribe spoken descriptions for my screenshots

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Recording Button UI:**
  - A button labeled "Record Voice" is added to the extension popup.
  - The button provides visual feedback (e.g., color change or animation) when recording is in progress.
- **Voice Recording Functionality:**
  - Clicking the "Record Voice" button activates the Web Speech API to capture voice input.
  - The system checks for browser support of the Web Speech API.
  - If the browser does not support the API, an informative message is displayed to the user.
- **Permission Handling:**
  - The extension requests microphone access from the user.
  - If the user denies permission, an error message is displayed explaining that voice input cannot proceed without microphone access.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Appropriate error messages are shown for scenarios such as:
    - No microphone detected.
    - Network connectivity issues.
    - Speech not recognized.

**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Browser Support Check:**
   - Use feature detection to check for `webkitSpeechRecognition` support.
   - Display an upgrade or informative message if not supported.

2. **Design Recording Button UI:**
   - Create a "Record Voice" button with clear visual indicators.
   - Implement visual feedback (e.g., color change, pulsating effect) during recording.

3. **Integrate Web Speech API:**
   - Instantiate `webkitSpeechRecognition` object.
   - Configure recognition settings (`continuous`, `interimResults`, `lang`).

4. **Handle User Permissions:**
   - Implement logic to request microphone access.
   - Manage permission prompts based on HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

5. **Develop Event Handlers:**
   - `onstart`: Indicate that recording has started.
   - `onresult`: Process and store transcribed text.
   - `onerror`: Display error messages to the user.
   - `onend`: Reset the UI after recording ends.

6. **Error Handling and Messaging:**
   - Create user-friendly error messages for all potential issues.
   - Ensure messages are accessible and clear.
