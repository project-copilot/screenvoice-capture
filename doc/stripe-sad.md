# Chrome Extension with Stripe and Google Auth: Software Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level software architecture for a Chrome extension that integrates Stripe subscriptions and Google authentication. The primary objective is to provide a secure, scalable, and maintainable solution that enables users to create and manage their Stripe subscriptions, which is essential for unlocking and accessing premium features within the extension.

## 2. System Overview

The system consists of three main components:
1. Chrome Extension (Frontend)
2. Backend Server
3. External Services (Stripe, Google Auth)

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture Diagram

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|  Chrome Extension |<---->|  Backend Server   |<---->|  Stripe API       |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         ^                          ^
         |                          |
         v                          v
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
|  Google Auth API  |      |  Database         |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
```

## 3. Key Design Decisions

### 3.1 Authentication Flow

Decision: Implement Google Sign-In on the client-side and validate tokens on the server-side.

Rationale:
- Enhances security by keeping sensitive credentials away from the client.
- Centralizes authentication logic on the server.
- Facilitates seamless integration with other backend components.

Implementation:
1. Chrome extension initiates Google Sign-In using Chrome Identity API.
2. Extension sends the obtained Google token to the backend.
3. Backend validates the token with Google Auth API.
4. Upon successful validation, backend creates or updates the user record and issues a session token.

### 3.2 Subscription Management

Decision: Use Stripe Customer Portal for managing subscriptions, with subscription creation and updates handled through Stripe webhooks.

Rationale:
- The Stripe Customer Portal offers a secure, pre-built interface for users to create and manage their subscriptions, reducing the need for custom UI development.
- Webhooks ensure real-time synchronization between Stripe and the backend, enabling accurate tracking of subscription status.

Implementation:
1. User initiates the subscription process from the Chrome extension, which triggers the backend to create a Stripe Customer Portal session.
2. The Chrome extension opens the portal URL in a new tab, where the user can create or manage their subscription.
3. Stripe webhooks notify the backend of subscription creation, updates, or changes.
4. Backend processes webhook events to create or update user subscriptions in the database.
5. The subscription status is validated each time a user attempts to access premium features.

### 3.3 Feature Access Control

Decision: Implement feature gating based on subscription status, enforced on both the client and server sides.

Rationale:
- Client-side gating provides immediate feedback to users regarding their subscription status.
- Server-side validation ensures security and prevents unauthorized access to premium features.

Implementation:
1. Chrome extension checks local storage for subscription status before enabling premium features.
2. All API calls related to premium features are validated on the server against the user's current subscription status stored in the database.

### 3.4 Data Storage

Decision: Use PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

Rationale:
- Provides robust support for complex queries and transactions.
- Offers good performance and scalability.
- Has strong community support and a rich ecosystem of tools.

### 3.5 API Design

Decision: Implement a RESTful API with JWT authentication.

Rationale:
- REST provides a standardized, scalable approach to API design.
- JWTs allow for stateless authentication, improving scalability.

Key Endpoints:
- POST /auth/google: Validate Google token and create session
- GET /subscription/status: Check current subscription status
- POST /subscription/create: Handle subscription creation via webhook
- POST /subscription/portal: Generate Stripe Customer Portal link

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Token Handling
- Store JWT tokens securely in the Chrome extension using chrome.storage.local.
- Implement a token refresh mechanism to limit exposure to long-lived tokens.

### 4.2 HTTPS
- Enforce HTTPS for all communications between the extension and the backend.

### 4.3 Content Security Policy
- Implement a strict Content Security Policy in the Chrome extension to prevent XSS attacks.

### 4.4 API Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on the backend to prevent abuse and potential DDoS attacks.

### 4.5 Secure Storage
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) on the backend.
- Encrypt sensitive user data in the database.

## 5. Scalability Considerations

### 5.1 Database Indexing
- Implement appropriate indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., user_id, subscription_status) to improve query performance.

### 5.2 Caching
- Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like subscription status.

### 5.3 Horizontal Scaling
- Design the backend to be stateless, allowing for easy horizontal scaling behind a load balancer.

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

### 6.1 Application Monitoring
- Implement application performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) to track system health and performance.

### 6.2 Error Logging
- Set up centralized error logging to quickly identify and diagnose issues.

### 6.3 Audit Logging
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations (e.g., subscription changes, authentication attempts) for security and compliance purposes.

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Unit Testing
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for both frontend and backend components.

### 7.2 Integration Testing
- Develop integration tests to ensure proper communication between the Chrome extension and the backend.

### 7.3 End-to-End Testing
- Create end-to-end tests simulating the entire user journey, including authentication and subscription processes.

### 7.4 Security Testing
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## 8. Deployment Strategy

### 8.1 Backend Deployment
- Use a containerization solution (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployment across environments.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### 8.2 Database Migration
- Use a database migration tool (e.g., Flyway) to manage schema changes and data migrations.

### 8.3 Chrome Extension Deployment
- Implement a staged rollout process for the Chrome extension, starting with a small percentage of users.

## 9. Future Considerations

- Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Explore offline capabilities for certain extension features.
- Consider implementing a microservices architecture for better scalability as the system grows.

This software architecture document provides a high-level overview of the design decisions and considerations for implementing a Chrome extension with Stripe subscriptions and Google authentication. It emphasizes the critical role of the Stripe Customer Portal in managing subscriptions and ensures that users must have an active subscription to access premium features.
