# Grooming Call Transcript: Voice Input for Screenshot Descriptions

**Date:** September 3, 2024  
**Attendees:** Sarah (Product Owner), Mike (Lead Developer), Emily (UX Designer), Alex (QA Engineer)

Sarah: Hi team, today we're focusing on defining an epic for adding voice-to-text functionality to our Screenshot Enhancer extension. The goal is to break this down into one epic and three key user stories. Mike, can you kick us off?

Mike: Sure, Sarah. The epic will encompass the entire voice-to-text feature, including voice capture, text creation, and saving the output. From this epic, we can define three specific user stories: voice capture, text preview, and saving the content.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's start with the first user story, voice capture. Mike, what do we need to do here?

Mike: For the voice capture user story, we need to add a button to the extension popup that, when clicked, activates the Web Speech API to record the user's voice.

Emily: We should make the button visually clear when it's recording, perhaps through a color change or animation.

Alex: And we need to handle cases where the browser doesn't support the API or the user doesn't grant microphone permissions. These error-handling scenarios should be included in the acceptance criteria.

Sarah: Agreed. So, our first user story is well-defined. Let's move on to the second user story: previewing the captured text. Mike?

Mike: Once we have the voice captured and converted to text, we should display a preview of this text along with the screenshot in the extension. This allows users to review and edit the text if necessary.

Emily: I'll design a preview interface where the text appears below a thumbnail of the screenshot, with options for the user to edit the text.

Alex: We need to ensure this preview works well with various text lengths and consider any edge cases.

Sarah: Excellent. That's our second user story. Finally, let's talk about saving the content, our third user story. Mike?

Mike: For the final user story, we'll extend our existing save functionality to allow users to save both the screenshot and the transcribed text as separate files. We'll give users the option to choose what to saveâ€”either the image, the text, or both.

Emily: I'll include checkboxes in the design to make these options clear to the user.

Sarah: Great input, everyone. To recap, we have one epic to implement voice-to-text functionality, which we'll break down into these three user stories:
1. **Voice Capture:** Implement the Web Speech API to capture voice input.
2. **Text Preview:** Create an interface to preview and edit the transcribed text alongside the screenshot.
3. **Content Saving:** Extend save functionality to include options for saving the text and image.

Mike, how long do you think this will take?

Mike: We should be able to complete the voice capture and text preview in one sprint, and then tackle the save functionality in the next sprint.

Sarah: That sounds good. Emily, can you have designs ready for sprint planning next week?

Emily: Absolutely. I'll mock up the recording button and the preview interface.

Sarah: Perfect. And Alex, could you start drafting test cases for each user story?

Alex: Sure thing. I'll focus on edge cases and error handling.

Sarah: Great work, team. Let's reconvene next week to finalize estimates and kick off the sprint.
