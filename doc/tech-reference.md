# Web Speech API Technical Reference

[Source: Voice driven web apps - Introduction to the Web Speech API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/voice-driven-web-apps-introduction-to-the-web-speech-api)

## Overview
The Web Speech API allows for easy integration of speech recognition capabilities into web applications. This API is supported in Chrome version 25 and later, providing fine control and flexibility over speech recognition features.

## Key Components

### 1. Browser Support Check
```javascript
if (!('webkitSpeechRecognition' in window)) {
    upgrade();
} else {
    // Implement speech recognition
}
```
- Check if the browser supports the Web Speech API
- Note: The API is currently vendor prefixed (webkit)

### 2. SpeechRecognition Object
```javascript
var recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
```
- Create a new SpeechRecognition object to interface with the API

### 3. Configuration Options
```javascript
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = true;
```
- `continuous`: If true, recognition continues even when the user pauses speaking
- `interimResults`: If true, interim results are returned (may change as recognition progresses)

### 4. Language Setting
```javascript
recognition.lang = 'en-US';
```
- Set the language for speech recognition (BCP-47 format)
- Supports multiple languages (refer to the 'langs' table in the demo source)

### 5. Event Handlers
```javascript
recognition.onstart = function() { /* ... */ }
recognition.onresult = function(event) { /* ... */ }
recognition.onerror = function(event) { /* ... */ }
recognition.onend = function() { /* ... */ }
```
- `onstart`: Fired when the speech recognition service begins listening
- `onresult`: Fired when the speech recognizer returns a result
- `onerror`: Fired when a speech recognition error occurs
- `onend`: Fired when the speech recognition service disconnects

### 6. Starting Recognition
```javascript
recognition.start();
```
- Begins capturing audio and starts the speech recognition process

### 7. Handling Results
```javascript
recognition.onresult = function(event) {
    var interim_transcript = '';
    var final_transcript = '';

    for (var i = event.resultIndex; i < event.results.length; ++i) {
        if (event.results[i].isFinal) {
            final_transcript += event.results[i][0].transcript;
        } else {
            interim_transcript += event.results[i][0].transcript;
        }
    }
    // Use final_transcript and interim_transcript as needed
}
```
- Process both final and interim results
- Final results won't change, interim results may be updated

## Implementation Considerations

1. **User Permissions**: First-time usage requires user permission to access the microphone
   - HTTPS: Permission asked once
   - HTTP: Permission asked repeatedly

2. **Visual Feedback**: Provide clear indicators for:
   - When the app is listening
   - When speech is being processed
   - When results are final

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for scenarios like:
   - No microphone access
   - Network issues
   - Unrecognized speech

4. **Text Processing**: Consider implementing functions for:
   - Capitalizing text
   - Converting line breaks to HTML tags

5. **Performance**: For efficiency, consider appending only new final text instead of rebuilding the entire transcript

6. **Accessibility**: Ensure the interface is accessible, including for screen reader users

## Security and Privacy

- Refer to the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper for information on how voice data is handled
- Consider implementing user controls for data privacy and retention

This technical reference provides a foundation for implementing speech recognition in the Screenshot Enhancer extension, helping both the program manager in backlog creation and the developer in code implementation.
