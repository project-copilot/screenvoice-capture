**Matias:** Hi, Project Copilot! I’ve recently enhanced my Chrome extension with image capture and voice-to-text conversion features. Now, I need your help in planning some new upgrades. Let’s discuss the details before we move forward with generating the backlog.

**Project Copilot:** That sounds like an exciting project! Let's discuss the details of the new upgrades you have in mind for your Chrome extension. Could you please provide more information about the specific features or enhancements you are planning to add? This will help me understand the complexity and scope of the task, and we can decide if we need to create a detailed plan for it.

**Matias:** The first upgrade I want to discuss is adding Google Authentication. This will allow users to sign in securely before using the extension.

**Project Copilot:** Adding Google Authentication is a great way to enhance the security and user experience of your Chrome extension. This task involves several steps, including setting up the Google API, integrating the authentication flow, and handling user sessions.

Given the complexity of this task, it may require detailed planning.

Do you want me to create the plan for adding Google Authentication to your Chrome extension? Yes or No

**Matias:** No, please keep listening. I also want to integrate Stripe to add paid subscriptions. I'm thinking of offering a premium tier for the chrome extension, where users can access certain advanced features. We need to incorporate into the chrome extension the possibility of subscribing to premium features through stripe.

**Project Copilot**: Integrating Stripe for paid subscriptions is another significant upgrade that involves setting up the Stripe API, creating subscription plans, handling payments, and managing user access to premium features.

Given the complexity of both adding Google Authentication and integrating Stripe for paid subscriptions, it seems like these tasks will require detailed planning.

Do you want me to create the plan for these upgrades? Yes or No

**Matias:** No, please keep listening. These are the features that will be part of the premium tier: The voice-to-text conversion feature will be moved to the premium tier. Basic features, like image capture, will remain free, but users will need a subscription to access the voice-to-text functionality.

**Project Copilot:** Thank you for providing the details about the premium tier features. Moving the voice-to-text conversion feature to the premium tier and keeping the image capture feature free will require careful planning to ensure a smooth user experience and proper access control.

Given the complexity of adding Google Authentication, integrating Stripe for paid subscriptions, and managing feature access based on subscription tiers, it seems like these tasks will require detailed planning.

Do you want me to create the plan for these upgrades? Yes or No

**Matias:** No, please keep listening, I’d like the backlog to be organized into separate epics for each of these features: one for Google Authentication, one for Stripe integration, and one for converting voice-to-text to a premium feature. Each epic should include user stories that cover all necessary tasks, like setting up the Google OAuth process, implementing the Stripe API, and updating the UI to reflect the premium features. Please keep in mind this criteria to create the backlog.

**Project Copilot:** Thank you for providing the detailed criteria for organizing the backlog. Given the complexity and the need to organize the backlog into separate epics with user stories, this task will require detailed planning.

Do you want me to create the plan for generating the backlog with the specified epics and user stories? Yes or No

**Matias:** (I attached the software architecture document here)

**Matias:** Yes, please create a backlog following the criteria described in the chat messages and using the attached software architecture document as a reference. Once the backlog is generated, import the issues into Jira.
