**Matias:** Hi, Project Copilot! I’ve recently enhanced my Chrome extension with image capture and voice-to-text conversion features. Now, I need your help in planning some new upgrades. Let’s discuss the details before we move forward with generating the backlog.

**Project Copilot:** That sounds like an exciting project! Let's discuss the details of the new upgrades you have in mind. Could you please provide more information about the specific features or enhancements you are planning to add to your Chrome extension? This will help me understand the complexity of the task and determine if we need to create a detailed plan.

**Matias:** The first upgrade I want to discuss is adding Google Authentication. This will allow users to sign in securely before using the extension.

**Project Copilot:** Adding Google Authentication is a great feature that will enhance the security and user experience of your Chrome extension. This task involves several steps, including setting up the authentication flow, integrating with Google's OAuth 2.0 API, and handling user sessions.

This is a complex task that may require detailed planning. Do you want me to create the plan for this upgrade? Yes or No

**Matias:** No, please keep listening. I also want to integrate Stripe to add paid subscriptions. I'm thinking of offering a premium tier for the chrome extension, where users can access certain advanced features. We need to incorporate into the chrome extension the possibility of subscribing to premium features through stripe.

**Project Copilot**: Integrating Stripe for paid subscriptions and offering a premium tier is another significant enhancement that involves multiple steps, such as setting up the Stripe API, handling payments, managing subscription tiers, and ensuring secure transactions.

This is also a complex task that may require detailed planning. Do you want me to create the plan for this upgrade? Yes or No

**Matias:** No, please keep listening. These are the features that will be part of the premium tier: The voice-to-text conversion feature will be moved to the premium tier. Basic features, like image capture, will remain free, but users will need a subscription to access the voice-to-text functionality.

**Project Copilot:** Got it. Moving the voice-to-text conversion feature to the premium tier while keeping the image capture feature free is a strategic decision that will help differentiate between the free and premium offerings.

Given the complexity of integrating Google Authentication, Stripe for paid subscriptions, and managing feature access based on subscription tiers, it seems like a detailed plan would be beneficial.

Do you want me to create the plan for these upgrades? Yes or No

**Matias:** No, please keep listening, I’d like the backlog to be organized into separate epics for each of these features: one for Google Authentication, one for Stripe integration, and one for converting voice-to-text to a premium feature. Each epic should include user stories that cover all necessary tasks, like setting up the Google OAuth process, implementing the Stripe API, and updating the UI to reflect the premium features. Please keep in mind this criteria to create the backlog.

**Project Copilot:** Understood. Organizing the backlog into separate epics for each feature and including detailed user stories for each task is a great approach to manage the project effectively.

Given the detailed criteria and the complexity of the tasks involved, it seems like creating a comprehensive plan would be the best way to proceed.

Do you want me to create the plan for generating the backlog with the specified epics and user stories? Yes or No

**Matias:** (I attached the software architecture document here)

**Matias:** Yes, please create a backlog following the criteria described in the chat messages and using the attached software architecture document as a reference. Once the backlog is generated, import the issues into Jira.
